# Clearway CICD
A experimental CICD process of [Clearway Solution Ltd](http://clearway.vn/).

# Description

Our project is using microservices architecture. Currently, we don't have a good CICD process, so I have to learn a few good CICD practices to improve our team performance. This project is a place to experiment my knowledge. I will build a simple application with microservices architecture. 

**Tools**:
- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
- [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) (or [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/))
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (container engine)
- [ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) (EC2 Container Engine)


# Application repository

- [Service discovery]()
- [Configuration store]()
- [Service 1]()
- [Service 2]()
- [API gateway]()

# FAQ

1. **Why ECS ?**

   After spending a lot of time learning and using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), I found that the cost of using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) on AWS is not cheap. So I deciced to try [ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/). (*When in Rome, do as the Romans do*).
